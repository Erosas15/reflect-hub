## Instructions to Run

### Prerequisites for Running

The code on this GitHub repository won't execute independently, as it lacks the necessary API keys for security reasons. To run this web application locally, please email [reachsragvi@gmail.com](mailto:reachsragvi@gmail.com) to obtain the required API key details. The application will function once you receive instructions on how to add the API key information.

### How to Set Up Your Own API Keys

1. **Create a Configuration File:** Start by creating a json file named `config.json` in the server directory.

2. **Firebase API Configuration:**

   - Add a json object named "firebaseAPIConfig" to your `config.json`.
   - Reach out to us to get the JSON object tailored for our Firebase Database.

3. **Firebase Service Configuration:**

   - Introduce another JSON object called "firebaseServiceConfig" to `config.json`.
   - Once again, reach out to us for the specific JSON object linked to the service-account on Firebase.

4. **OpenAI Configuration:**
   - To get the OpenAI config and make your chatbot run smoothly, create a third JSON object named "OpenAIConfig" in `config.json`.
   - Don't hesitate to ask us for this JSON object‚Äîyour key to unleashing the power of OpenAI.

**Example `config.json`**

```json
{
  "firebaseAPIConfig": {
    "apiKey": "<your_api_key>",
    "authDomain": "<your_data>",
    "projectId": "<your_data>",
    "storageBucket": "<your_data>",
    "messagingSenderId": "<your_data>",
    "appId": "<your_data>",
    "measurementId": "<your_data>"
  },
  "firebaseServiceConfig": {
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "<your_data>",
    "private_key_id": "<your_data>",
    "private_key": "<your_data>",
    "client_email": "<your_data>",
    "client_id": "<your_data>",
    "auth_uri": "<your_data>",
    "token_uri": "<your_data>",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "<your_data>",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "<your_data>",
    "universe_domain": "<your_data>"
  },
  "openAIConfig": {
    "apiKey": "<your_data>",
    "modelName": "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct"
  }
}
```
